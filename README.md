# Problem Statement
Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.
# Steps Involved:
# Step 1: Data Preparation:
Collect and preprocess the customer purchase history data. Each customer's purchase history should be represented as a set of features (e.g., total spending, frequency of purchases, types of products purchased, etc.). Make sure the data is cleaned and standardized if necessary.

# Step 2: Choose the Number of Clusters (K):
Determine the number of clusters you want to group customers into. This can be done using domain knowledge or by using methods like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score to find an appropriate value for K.

# Step 3: Initialize Cluster Centers:
Randomly initialize K cluster centers. Each cluster center is a point in the feature space that represents the centroid of the data points assigned to that cluster.

# Step 4: Assign Data Points to Clusters:
For each data point (customer), calculate its distance from each cluster center and assign it to the nearest cluster. The distance metric used could be Euclidean distance or any other suitable distance metric based on your data.

# Step 5: Update Cluster Centers:
After all data points have been assigned to clusters, calculate the new cluster centers by taking the mean of the feature values of the data points in each cluster.

# Step 6: Repeat Steps 4 and 5:
Repeat the assignment and update steps iteratively until convergence. Convergence is reached when the cluster assignments no longer change significantly or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

# Step 7: Evaluate Clustering:
After convergence, evaluate the quality of the clustering. You can use metrics like the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) to measure how close the data points are to their respective cluster centers.

# Step 8: Interpret Results:
Interpret the results by analyzing the characteristics of each cluster. Identify common purchase behaviors, spending patterns, or other insights that emerge from the clustering.

# Step 9: Predict New Data:
You can use the trained K-means model to predict which cluster new customers belong to based on their purchase history.

# Step 10: Post-processing and Refinement:
Depending on the insights you've gained from the clustering, you might want to refine your approach, adjust the number of clusters, or incorporate additional features into the model.
